# Pandion
django database set up for thr Pandion website, at: http://pandionorbital.com/index.html?

Implement a schema for a database of missions

Search function for the database - when the user clicks the search button, it searches the database for missions that are of the correct orbit and have enough space for the amount of U's they need.

It then instantiates a golden button bar item for every mission that fits the search.
